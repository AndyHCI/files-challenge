		<p>Master Chief is the main character in the science fiction world: Halo. He is a biologically enhanced human made for the elite military force to fight off more advanced alien civilizations. Recruited when he was a child, John (referred to as Master Chief), is the last hope to protect the human race. He is paired with an artificial intelligence hologram called Cortana (now on Windows Phone!) who helps him navigate through alien worlds.</p>
